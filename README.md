# philosophers

Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.

The specific rules for the mandatory part are: 
â€¢ Each philosopher should be a thread.
â€¢ There is one fork between each pair of philosophers. Therefore, if there are several philosophers, each philosopher has a fork on their left side and a fork on their right side. If there is only one philosopher, there should be only one fork on the table. 
â€¢ To prevent philosophers from duplicating forks, you should protect the forks state with a mutex for each of them
